      The age old question <b>WHAT ARE BIRDS?</b>, has yet to be answered. In this small paragraph, I shall try and explain what birds are exactly.
      Birds are pretty neat, they are fluffy little flying things. They flap their wings and soar through the air. There are many different types of birds.
      For example, there are Blue Jays, Owls, Chickens, and my personal favorite, Pigeons! Not all birds can fly unfortuately, but they are still birds nontheless.
      Birds do not really have teeth, but they do have beaks that they use to eat with. Birds also lay eggs that hatch into little baby birds, they are pretty cute.
      Birds are amazing animals, and should be treated with respect!
