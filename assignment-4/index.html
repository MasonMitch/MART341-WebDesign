<p>1. Browsers use different languages (html, css, and java) to write various instructions that are then rendered into the design/layout of the website.

    2. The DOM is is an interface that turns another interface into a document and states how that document is accessed and changed through modifying its structure. 
    
    3. HTML has tagging system and can render content and page structure. XML makes it easy to transport data and allows for upgrades without losing any data. XHTML is nearly identical to HTML, but it has strict code requirements that make it harder to make changes. However it tends to be easier to maintain. 
    
    4. Document type, the root element, the head element, and the body element.
    
    5. index.html allows the browser to look for a index.html from the host server when a URL is passed through that does not specify a file.
    
    6. No spaces and no weird characters.</p>
