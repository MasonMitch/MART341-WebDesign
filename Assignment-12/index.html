            At #3, I have the flying chicken. This chicken is quite a rare specimen. Chickens cannot fly, but this chicken can be seen breaking the rules. This chicken 
            sees no bounries, and can be rambunctious. This chicken can be dangerous due to its uproarious nature and is a rule breaker at heart. For these reasons, I 
            believe it is deserving of the #3 spot on this list.

            In my #2 spot on <i>Top 3 Chickens</i>, I have the illustrious Sea Chicken. This is a very well known chicken, it can be found just about everywhere in the water.
            This chicken enjoys swimming, eating, sleeping, and wreaking havoc under the sea. Very normal chicken behavior. Professional chicken psychologist Dr. Mason Mitchell
            has been reported saying, "The Sea Chicken is very cool". That is all he had to say, and that is all I needed to justify putting the Sea Chicken at #2 on this list.
