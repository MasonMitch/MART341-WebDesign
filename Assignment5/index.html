<h1>Dune</h1>
<h2>Frank Herbert</h2>
<hr />
<p>In the far future, manipulation of the equations necessary for interstellar travel can only be accomplished through the aid of the narcotic “spice” or “melange,” which can only be found on one planet, Arrakis—also called Dune. The galaxy is divided into aristocratic houses under the leadership of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. Fearing the rise of House Atreides of the oceanic planet Caladan, Shaddam IV orders House Atreides to take over Arrakis and spice mining from their longtime enemies House Harkonnen but plans to help the Harkonnens destroy the Atreides after their arrival on Arrakis.</p>

<p>Duke Leto, leader of House Atreides, suspects a trap. His concubine Lady Jessica is a member of the Bene Gesserit, an entirely female religious group that through its manipulation of aristocratic bloodlines over millennia hopes to produce a superbeing, the Kwisatz Haderach. Jessica was to have given birth to a daughter who would have married a Harkonnen and would have likely produced the Kwisatz Haderach as their son. Instead, because of her love for Leto, who desired a son, she bore Paul, trained him in the ways of the Bene Gesserit, and hopes that he could be the Kwisatz Haderach. Paul already shows signs of extraordinary capabilities with his prophetic dreams of life on Arrakis.</p>

<p>Once on Arrakis, Leto proves himself a benevolent ruler, a contrast to the harsh ruler Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. He saves the crew of a spice harvester from being swallowed by a giant sandworm and reaches out to Stilgar, a leader of the Fremen, the human inhabitants of the desert. However, the Harkonnens, aided by the emperor’s Sardaukar troops, launch their attack. Duke Leto is betrayed to the Harkonnens by his doctor, Wellington Yueh, who seeks to free his wife from Harkonnen captivity, but Yueh also arranges for Paul and Jessica to escape their captors and flee into the desert. Yueh delivers Leto to Baron Harkonnen but not before putting in his mouth a false tooth that will release a lethal vapour when bitten. Leto crushes the tooth and dies but fails to kill the baron.</p>

<p>Exposed to the spice-filled desert, Pauls latent abilities to discern both the past and the future begin to awaken. He reveals to Jessica her origins as a daughter of Baron Harkonnen, and he sees visions of the future in which the Fremen unleash a jihad on the galaxy in his name. He and Jessica join the “sietch” (Fremen community) led by Stilgar, and Paul meets a young woman, Chani, whom he recognizes from his earlier visions. Among the Fremen, Paul assumes the name “Paul-Muad’Dib.” Paul and Jessica discover that Stilgar and the Fremen have large underground caches of water in order to change Arrakis from a desert world to one rich in water.</p>

<p>The Fremens religion was influenced by the Bene Gesserit, and Jessica agrees to replace the old reverend mother at Stilgar’s sietch. She drinks the Water of Life, which grants her the memories of previous reverend mothers going back millennia. The Water of Life also grants the same awareness to her unborn daughter, Alia.</p>

<p>Paul trains the Fremen in the Weirding Way, the Bene Gesserit technique of hand-to-hand combat, and he and the Fremen throttle spice production through their raids. He and Chani have a son, Leto II. Paul fully embraces the Fremen culture and is regarded by them as their promised messiah. Paul and Stilgar have a skirmish with a band of spice smugglers in the desert and discover that they are led by Gurney Halleck, an adviser of Duke Leto who instructed Paul in the use of weapons. Gurney attempts to kill Jessica, believing that it was she who betrayed Duke Leto to the Harkonnens. Paul and Jessica convince him of the truth, but Paul is concerned that he did not foresee Gurney’s attack. He takes a drop of the Water of Life to increase his clairvoyant power.</p>

<p>After three weeks in a coma, Paul awakens with the awareness that he is indeed the Kwisatz Haderach long planned by the Bene Gesserit and that the emperor and Baron Harkonnen have come to Arrakis to attack the Fremen and restart spice production. As Paul is preparing to attack the capital, Arrakeen, Sardaukar troops raid a sietch where they believe Paul to be. The Sardaukar capture Alia and kill Paul’s son. Brought before the emperor and the baron as Paul begins his attack, Alia kills the baron with a poison needle. Paul and the Fremen capture Arrakeen. Paul threatens the emperor with planet-wide destruction of the spice unless he abdicates in favour of Paul. The emperor does so and grants Paul his daughter Irulan’s hand in marriage. Paul restores House Atreides to its rightful place and destroys the Harkonnens but must live knowing that the Fremen’s zealous worship of him will lead to a jihad that will rage across the universe.</p>
